I run [Skylarq AI](https://skylarq.com) — a general-purpose AI assistant built for go-to-market teams. Sales and GTM is full of repetitive, high-context work: researching prospects, updating CRMs, writing outreach, keeping LinkedIn active, running task workflows across tools. Skylarq handles all of it. Think of it as an AI teammate that knows your pipeline and gets things done.

Previously founded [Homebase](https://homebase.com.vn) at 24 — raised $30M+ in debt and equity, grew to 120+ people, and became the first YC company from Vietnam.

Caltech CS → McKinsey → founder. Harvard HBS MS/MBA. Schwarzman Scholar (C10). Forbes 30 Under 30. Passionate about geopolitics, AI, and building things. Former competitive NCAA swimmer.

### 🔨 What I'm shipping

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| 🎙️ [Philoquent](https://github.com/phillipan14/philoquent) | **Voice-to-text that just works.** Hold Fn+Tab, speak naturally, release — your words appear wherever your cursor is. Live transcription preview as you talk, accurate final output. 100% local, nothing leaves your machine. Great for emails, docs, Slack messages, or anywhere you'd rather talk than type. |
| 🎨 [Philadeck](https://github.com/phillipan14/philadeck) | **Slide decks in seconds.** Describe your topic, review an AI-generated outline, then get a full presentation with charts, images, diagrams, and 12 beautiful themes. Edit everything inline, drag to reorder, export to PowerPoint/Keynote. No signup required — runs in your browser. |
| 🎵 [PhilHarmonic](https://github.com/phillipan14/philharmonic) | **Create music from a text prompt.** Type a mood or genre ("lo-fi beats for studying", "epic cinematic orchestral") and get original audio powered by MiniMax Music v2. 10 genre presets, waveform visualizer, download as MP3. Open-source. |
| 🔍 [PhilTer](https://github.com/phillipan14/philter) | **LinkedIn profile change tracker.** Monitor profiles for job changes, title updates, and headline rewrites. Visual diff timeline, email notifications via Resend, demo mode with sample data. For market research purposes, obviously. |
